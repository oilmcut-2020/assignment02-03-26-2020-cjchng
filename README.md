**Week03 : 03-26-2020**

Hello, this is Week 3rd for your JAVA-CLASS.I hope you all doing well and learning it day by day !!

Today, we will learn some sample examples for Java.

## Program 1 : Addition Program

In this we need to add two numbers, taking first number and second number from user and then giving formula to add two numbers 

      sum = number1 + number2; 
      
This will result in addition of two numbers.

## Program 2 : CheckEvenOdd

Java program to check whether a number is even or odd if it's divisible by two, then it's even, otherwise, odd. We use the modulus operator to find the remainder. For an even number, it's zero when it's divided by two (it's one for an odd number).
